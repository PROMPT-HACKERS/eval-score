## Branch Operation Rules
When moving from an approved plan to implementation, if the current branch is develop or a branch unrelated to the task, create a task-specific branch from develop (e.g., feature/xxx, fix/xxx).
If you are working on a task-specific branch and are about to make changes unrelated to that branch’s purpose, warn the user and suggest doing that work on a separate branch instead.
